Once upon a time, there was a beautiful garden full of colorful flowers. Among all the colors, there was one that shone the brightest - yellow. Yellow flowers of all shapes and sizes illuminated the garden, but the most magnificent of them all was the sunflower.
The sunflower was tall and proud, with a large round face that followed the sun all day long. Its petals were like rays of sunshine, spreading out in all directions. It stood in the middle of the garden, towering over all the other flowers, and its bright yellow petals attracted bees and butterflies from far and wide.
One day, a little girl came to the garden with her mother. She was fascinated by the sunflower and its beautiful yellow color. She stood in front of it, gazing up at its face, and asked her mother, "Why is the sunflower yellow?"
Her mother replied, "Well, yellow is a color that represents happiness, warmth, and sunshine. The sunflower is like a little piece of sunshine in our garden, and it reminds us that even on cloudy days, there is always something bright and beautiful to look at."
The little girl smiled and looked up at the sunflower once more. She felt happy just looking at it, and she knew that whenever she felt sad or down, she could come back to the garden and find comfort in the bright yellow sunflower.
From that day on, the little girl visited the garden every week, and she always made sure to stop by the sunflower. She watched as it grew taller and stronger, and she marveled at its beautiful yellow petals. She knew that the sunflower would always be there to brighten up her day, just like the color yellow always brought warmth and happiness to her heart.
And so, the sunflower stood tall and proud in the garden, shining like a little piece of sunshine for all to see. Its bright yellow color reminded everyone who saw it that even on the darkest of days, there was always something to be happy about.
